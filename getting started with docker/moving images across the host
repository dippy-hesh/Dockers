first is we have to save the image to .tar file

docker save busybox > busybox.tar
once it is done we can send this tar over then pen drive or mail
after that docker load > busybox.tar


code:
Base Dockerfile

FROM busybox
RUN touch custom.txt
CMD ["/bin/sh"]
docker build -t myapp .

Save and Load Images

docker save myapp > myapp.tar
docker load < myapp.tar
