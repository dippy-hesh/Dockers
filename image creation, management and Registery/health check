health check is used to check if your application is runing without any issues or not.
  first you need to create a container and get its ip address
create container : docker container run -dt --name po newport bash
get the ipaddress of that container
docker inspect po
create a dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s CMD ping -c 1 172.17.0.11
  again create a container with the image which we created now
and do docker ps
  another way:
docker container run -dt --name tmp --health-cmd "curl -f http//localhost" ubuntu bash
