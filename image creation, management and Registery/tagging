tagging is nothing but  giving name to a image or container if we forgot will creating it
if we forgot to give a name to a image while building it then in REPOSITORY it will show as none like below

<none>               <none>    86fa2e4b3c32   8 weeks ago    78.1MB

to give name for it we use tag

docker tag imeageid name
docker tag 86fa2e4b3c32 royal

royal                latest    86fa2e4b3c32   8 weeks ago    78.1MB
