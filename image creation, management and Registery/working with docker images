each docker container is build based on images. docker images are build based upon reading instrucations  from  dockfiles.
dockerfile is a text document that contain all the commands specify by user to make a image. to build a image you require a dockerfile.
once you create a dockerfile you have to execute build command to create a image
docker buils -t specify a name for your docker image and path where your file is present
docker build -t imagename .


formate of dockerfile
# comment   
instrucation argument
docker file must start FROM instrucation
from is nothing but from where you want to build from like centos ubuntu etc

we have alot of instrucations like FROM RUN CMD ADD COPY USER ENTRYPOINT VOLUME ENV etc


code to create a simple dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
COPY index.nginx-debian.html /var/www/html
CMD nginx -g 'daemon off;'
