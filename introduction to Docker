docker is open platform once you build it can be run anywhere 
generally there involve 2 steps in docker steps1 you have to download or pull or create the image which you want to run in your operating system
next we have to start the container. 
the code written by software devloper will be odstarted into packages and this pakage will be converted in to images from them we can start a lightweight machines
vms are heavy weight machine you have to install complete os. on top of hardware you have to install hyperverser on top of it you have
to install vm and you have install os as well when you run it it will run the code perfectly but it wont run in another vm because 
it may use linux or mac or windows. 
if you install docker engine on you machine like vms or laptop  on top of this docker engine we will run docker container.
