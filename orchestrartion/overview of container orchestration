once you build your container in different host machine how do you scale them up and dowm based on traffic this is done by using 
orchestration tool called kubernets. 

node is machine or vm where kubernets is installed in nide we have container node is also called as worker machine .
we should have more than 1 node a group od nodes are called as cluster. we have master node which will montor the node and 
distrubute the load amoung the workers nodes.
when you install kubernets in you machine then your installing following compnents in your machine.
api server--- it is font end for kubernets devices user cli will talk to this api server
etcd -- this store all the data realted to cluster 
scheduler -- it distrube the load between the nodes
controller -- it will montior the node if they go down it will bring new containers nodes or endpoints
coniner runtime -- this will run the container
kublet-- it is gent it make sure container are runing in node

worker node contains kubctl agent which communicate with master server and container runtime
master node contains scheduler etcd controller api server
