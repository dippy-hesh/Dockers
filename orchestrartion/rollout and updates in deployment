roolout: deploying a application in kubernets
roolback: if something goes wrong during deployment you want to revert to old version this is called rool back
when you deploy a new application this is revision 1
when there are new featured avaiable and you update the application then new rollout will be taking place and it is revision 2
this rollout and revision will help you to keep track of changes we made and this will help us to keep track
there are 2 stratergy 
1 recreate where we take down all pods at a time and create new pods draw back is application wont be avaiable untill you create a new 
pods
2 rooling update : by default kubernets use this stratergy because it will take down 1 pod at a time and create a new pod.
updating your deployment means if we have change your existing labs or apps or version of your image once update is done in the file

first create a deployment by using yml file once code is placed in yml create a deployment
kubectl create -f deployment.yml
kubectl get deployment
kubectl apply -f deploymt.yml
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment/my-deplyment
