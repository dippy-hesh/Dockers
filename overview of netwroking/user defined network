you can create your own user defined bridge network which look simillar to bridge newt work
if you want to create your own bridge

docker network create --drive mydrive bridge
mydrive is the name of the bridge.

in user defined if you want to communicate from 1 container to another you no need to specify container ip dns name will be fine
dns name is nothing but docker container name

in bridge ping 182.18.0.0
in user defined bridge ping container name
